1. Introduction
====================================================

Perhaps your group is on the move, and aside from a
quick congratulations you pay no attention to the
level you've just gained.

Perhaps you've been jumped by a group of enemies,
and although you've gained a level, you don't have
time to stop and ponder the best route of
advancement.

Perhaps you've just hit an even-numbered level, and
your first instinct is to run to the nearest trainer
and learn new abilities.

Whatever the case, if you're at all like me, the
talent tree is put on the back-burner while you're
involved with more pressing matters. At some point,
a friend will mention where they've spent their most
recent talent points. And, as you open your talent
tree, you notice all of the points which have been
stockpiling.

TalentReminder is a simple AddOn for World of
WarCraft which will notify the player if they have
unspent talent points. In the case that the player
is predisposed, it will remind the player repeatedly
until the points have been spent.

The notification appears in similar fashion to quest
updates: Text appears and a chime sounds, and the
text fades away soon after. If desired, the player
can easily set the interval at which TalentReminder
displays its notification.



====================================================
2. Installation
====================================================

TalentReminder is, like most AddOns for World of
WarCraft, very simple to install.

First, locate the World of WarCraft installation on
your computer.

All files within this zip file should be placed in
the following folder:

World of WarCraft\Interface\AddOns\TalentReminder\

The next time that you start World of WarCraft, you
should see a message stating that TalentReminder has
been loaded.



====================================================
3. Interaction
====================================================

By default, TalentReminder will alert you of unspent
talents every three minutes until you have spent
all of your points.

To change the default, use the following command:

/talentreminder interval <value>

The value you enter must be in minutes. Therefore a
value of '5' will alert you every five minutes, and
a value of '60' will alert you every hour.
