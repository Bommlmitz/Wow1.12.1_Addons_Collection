SoulStamp 0.2

When you drain a soul, SoulStamp remembers the source and adds the name in the tooltip
of the soul shard; for example:  <Created from Noxious Plaguebat>.

There is no practical purpose to this; however, it is very funny to mouse over your
soul shards after a battleground and see whose souls you have!
