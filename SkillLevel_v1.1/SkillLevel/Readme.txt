About 

This addon is very useful in helping quickly display what level your learned skills, like fishing, are. The level displayed in the skill bar is roughly equivalent to the character level it's related to. It's a pretty simple low overhead addon, but it removes busy work (math) for determining the skill level -> character level conversion. 

Usage Tips 

Knowing the equivalent character level of of your skills can help out when deciding what to do with them. In the case of the fishing skill, just go to an area that has the indicated level monsters for prime fishing skillup. For weapon skills, the level listed is the level that you are effectively fighting as.
