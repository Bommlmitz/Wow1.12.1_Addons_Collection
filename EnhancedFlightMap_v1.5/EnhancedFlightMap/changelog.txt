2006-08-29  Version 1.5
-----------------------
- Official release of 1.5.
- Still missing french translations for new text, but this can be updated later.
- .toc is matched to 1.12.


2006-08-17  Version 1.5b7
-------------------------
- Update to deDE locale details for Un'Goro Crater.
- Generic updates to deDE locale file.  Many thanks to those have supplied the necessary updates.
- Increase the allowed time difference between calculate time and recorded time, as some flight paths just seem to run a little strange...


2006-08-16  Version 1.5b6
-------------------------
- Correct issues the /efm clear all command, this new implementation should speed up processing time in various situations and also remove all bugs I saw of the other methods.


2006-08-14  Version 1.5b5
-------------------------
- Fix empty data set bug relating to data updating for the alliance moonglade flight node.
- Add function to load times for known flights only.  Current incarnation only adds single-hop flight data.
- Update configuration screen to toggle loading of known flight times or all data.


2006-08-14  Version 1.5b4b
--------------------------
- Quickie Fix for Crash when displaying remote flight map after talking to a flight master, this fix is only needed for 1.11, but it is programatically more correct, so it's staying :-)


2006-08-14  Version 1.5b4
-------------------------
- Remove Debug line from remote display.
- Fix Alliance Druid flight point display.
- Add function to move flight nodes around, this function will be called by EFM programatically in future versions as Blizzard moves flightpaths around.
- The above routine allows for moving of old Alliance Moonglade flight path to new location, this will update all references to the old flightnode to point to the new flightnode, and delete any duplicate entries.
- Update to flightpath data.


2006-08-13  Version 1.5b3
-------------------------
- Fix issue with remote flight display.  Blizzard modified the return value of certain functions and so the new method will result in extra processing due to this.
- Fix CastingBarFrame resize issue.
- Fix issue when attempting to display the remote flight display when in an instance, if no continent to display is given.
- Modify line and node drawing routines to line up with 1.12 styling, this makes the load-time memory usage a little less, and also means the node numbers and flight line numbers are no longer static.


2006-08-09  Version 1.5b2
-------------------------
- Update flightpath handling for druid flight paths.  System now hooks the gossip functions to figure out when flying from moonglade.  Currently all locales will have the druid flightpath listed as "Nighthaven, Moonglade".
- /efm clear all now clears ALL saved EFM data.  This includes known paths for the character as well as any settings the character has set.  This returns all EFM global data to defaults as EFM will have errors if it is attempted to be used after a complete clear.
- Added additional flight data, hopefully the preloaded data set now includes a complete 1.11 for Horde, and a complete 1.11 for Alliance (the latter is untested).


2006-08-08  Version 1.5b1
-------------------------
- Calculated flight time only displays if it is a multi-hop flight.
- Modify calc/recorded settings so that if the calculated flight time is more than 30 seconds different than recorded time replace the recorded flight time with the calculated time.
- If there are missing single-hop flights in a multi-hop flight path it will display a * beside the calculated flight time and not record the flight time.
- Fix nodeinfo file bug.
- Add keybindings for map display options.
- Remote map display now lists the name of the continent.
- Modify status bar display to attach text to the top of the standard casting bar, this means that I no longer need to care where the castingbarframe resides anymore, this also means it is unmovable from it's default location by EFM...
- Updates to German Locale in i18n.lua.


2006-06-22  Version 1.4.7
-------------------------
- Added a calculated duration line to the flight display.  Also use the calculated value if flying a multi-hop route of unknown time.
- Updated toc for 1.11


2006-05-08  Version 1.4.6
-------------------------
- Correct map line 91 error for non-enUS clients.
- Update Horde Data.


2006-04-26  Version 1.4.5

2006-04-19  Version 1.4.4
-------------------------
- Update i18n zone match error string to list the string we are trying to match using as well as the flight node.
- Add additional flight time data for horde to the preload data set.
- Update zone not found handling to be a little clearer.
- Update i18n zone matching to be a "plain" match and not accept magic characters.


2006-04-18  Version 1.4.3
-------------------------
- Modify event registration/unregistration to not even bother dealing with events between the PLAYER_LEAVING_WORLD and PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD events.
- Add timer hide to the PLAYER_LEAVING_WORLD event, this should catch any timers hanging around when you get portalled out while in flight.
- Modify EFM_FN_GetNodeByName function to look for bad data, and ignore if data bad.
- Additional changes to i18n coding.


2006-04-10  Version 1.4.2
-------------------------
- Fix error on login caused by misentered entry for missing zone mapping error message.
- Fix error at Flightmaster caused by the EFM_FN_GetNodeByName function.
- Minor code complexity reduction in the i18n code.


2006-04-10  Version 1.4.1
-------------------------
- Modify locale code to reference zone data from my own reference map, this should solve the zone name->number issue.
- Flight nodes that cannot be matched to known data will display an error message in the chat window to be reported for inclusion in the zone mapping table.
- Locale table converted to UTF-8 Decimal version strings.
- Add extra alliance data.


2006-04-04  Version 1.4
-----------------------
- Official 1.4 release
- Fix line clearing bug, blizzard flight lines where not previously being cleared from the efm remote display screen


2006-04-01  Version 1.4 Beta 11
-------------------------------
- BETA RELEASE FOR WOW 1.10 RELEASE.
- Add option to clear data for a single faction, this way users can erase a faulty horde/alliance data set and not lose any data from the other faction.  Mostly added for testing, but I'm sure some will find this handy.
- Add hidden data precision conversion routine - this should only be used as directed by myself, or automatically used for those who have run a beta version of EFM 1.4 before.
- Data precisions are now defined globally, this allows users who need less precision in the map collection to adjust automatically.
- Hack CastingBarFrame modification routines to handle some CT_MasterMod weirdness, the progress bar location will not be movable, it will be stuck where the CT_Mod team has decided to place it.
- Fix bug with druid flight path showing when option disabled, and being hidden when enabled.
- Add additional Horde flight path data.
- Alliance data cleanup, data was being duplicated, this has been fixed.


2006-03-30  Version 1.4 Beta 10
-------------------------------
- BETA RELEASE FOR WOW 1.10 RELEASE.
- Modify CastingBarFrame data collection settings.
- Fix flightpath collection for Nighthave, Moonglade, same issue as with Silithus.
- Fix map data collection for Orgrimmar.
- Add some additional Horde and Alliance data.


2006-03-28  Version 1.4 Beta 9
------------------------------
- BETA RELEASE FOR WOW 1.10 RELEASE.
- Correct issue with CastingBarFrame disappearing after taking a flight.
- Clean up remaining Lys_Library function call.


2006-03-28  Version 1.4 Beta 8
------------------------------
- BETA RELEASE FOR WOW 1.10 RELEASE.
- Correct data load bug.
- Move timer init into main init routine.
- Move init routines to ADDON_LOADED event handler.


2006-03-28  Version 1.4 Beta 7
------------------------------
- BETA RELEASE FOR WOW 1.10 RELEASE.
- Correct colour code bug.  This bug was due to removing the pre-dependance upon Lys_Library (Which will soon go out of development, and has not been updated for 1.10 anyhow).


2006-03-28  Version 1.4 Beta 6
------------------------------
- BETA RELEASE FOR WOW 1.10 RELEASE.
- Fix configuration import bug.


2006-03-23  Version 1.4 Beta 5
------------------------------
- BETA RELEASE FOR WOW 1.10 RELEASE.
- Remove all but the basic command line options.  All config is now handled via the GUI menu.
- Clean up of unused display strings.
- Update so the changes Blizzard made to test realm do not break the remote report screen.
- Shared functions have been cleaned up (unused functions removed) and addon no longer depends (even suggested) upon Lys_Library which is soon do be removed.
- In-flight timer bar is now built using the blizzard CastingBarFrame.  I can think of no time while in flight the CastingBarFrame will be possible to get used while in flight, hence the change.
- Added tooltips to the configuration screen.
- Added an option to shift the in-flight display up or down on the screen.
- Updated frFR and deDE locale files.  These files now match lines almost exactly with the english locale file, lines not translated have been commented out but left in the files.
- Update to flight averaging code.  If flight time difference is more than 10 seconds we reset to the new time.  Either Blizzard updated the flight time, or else this is a multi-hop route and we went a different way this time.


2006-03-14  Version 1.4 Beta 4
------------------------------
- BETA RELEASE FOR WOW 1.10 RELEASE.
- Add flight time averaging.  Each repeat flight time calculation for a flight point will be averaged against the previous time if it's length is within 10 seconds of a previous flight along this route.


2006-03-13  Version 1.4 Beta 3
------------------------------
- BETA RELEASE FOR WOW 1.10 RELEASE.
- Taxi Data is now referenced in a locale-independant manner.  All previous data will need to be erased to handle the change.
- Taxi Data is now much more accessible for other functions due to the various routines created to access that data.
- Major overhaul to taxi data structure.  This should store the flight data in a language-independant system, meaning everyone who runs this addon should be able to share the data pool, rather than needing seperate data sets as before.


2006-03-10  Version 1.4 Beta 2
------------------------------
- BETA RELEASE FOR WOW 1.10 RELEASE.
- Update remote map display to use blizzard's new line draw function.

------------------------------
- BETA RELEASE FOR WOW 1.10 RELEASE.
- Many changes to support WoW 1.10.
- Disable flight cost data collection and display.

-------------------------
- Check for PLAYER_LEAVING_WORLD event and suspend all activities until we see the PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD event.
- Add globals.lua to centralise global variables.

- Fix flight map display issues.
- Modify init routine calls, all calls should now be done via main program.


2005-12-04  Version 1.3-beta8
-----------------------------
- BETA release
- Add raid channel for efm flight reporting


2005-11-30  Version 1.3-beta7
-----------------------------
- BETA release
- Correct linewidth bug
- Moved certain values to per-character variables, this change was done to reduce the amount of data stored globally.


2005-11-29  Version 1.3-beta6
-----------------------------
- BETA release
- Add check to see if the "arrival" continent is the same as the source continent.  This should never differ for a real flight.
- When in flight, if a summon dialogue (warlock only I think) is shown, flight time recording will cease immediately.


2005-11-05  Version 1.3-beta5
-----------------------------
- BETA release
- Add flight report option.  Detailed in help text


2005-10-25  Version 1.3-beta4
-----------------------------
- BETA release
- Change to 1.3 beta, as this will be a minor revision number change.
- Updates to horde data set.  Due to a minor issue the Valor's Rest flight path was still in the data set.


2005-10-23  Version 1.2.7-beta3
-------------------------------
- BETA release
- Add option to choose a specific continent when showing map screen. /efm open kalimdor for kalimdor, and /efm open azeroth for azeroth/eastern kingdoms.
- Issue with display of blizzard flight node data... might need a rebuild of the blizzard taxiframe just to handle this issue...


2005-10-22  Version 1.2.7-beta2
-------------------------------
- BETA release
- Modify flight node display code.  If show alt paths are enabled the remote flight master display shows the nodes the current character knows as yellow, grey for nodes not known.
- WorldMap update routine modified to correct bug where the update routine might be called before the loading of data.


2005-10-21  Version 1.2.7-beta
------------------------------
- BETA release
- Add non-flight master flight map display.  To view, use /efm open.  This acts like the flightmaster map with all nodes showing grey.  The same config as the normal flight master display applies, so if you have disabled remote flight nodes known by alts, then you won't see them on this map.


2005-10-18  Version 1.2.6
-------------------------
- Add slash command to remove a single flight node.  This should cover for the times when blizzard renames a flight node, just delete the old entry by it's name and then you will no longer have that data cluttering your display.
- Add keybinding for options screen.


2005-10-14  Version 1.2.5
--------------------------
- Patch 1.8 updates
- Alliance data for enUS submitted by jgleigh from curse-gaming.com.

- Remove unneeded section from xml file.


2005-09-27  Version 1.2.4b
--------------------------
- Correct LYS_LOADED library issue


2005-09-27  Version 1.2.4
-------------------------
- Update base library code.  The new library code should resolve the issue with the latest release of myAddOns, and also allow the options screen to be available once more.
- Include French flight-data supplied by Corwin.  At this time not all flight paths are in the default load for french, nor do all paths have times/costs, this will be corrected as I have time.
- Correct slashcommand issue.  Only one of the two slash commands was active.
- Cleanup of localization files.  All translators who have assisted with this, the new format should make translations easier, please look over this and re-do any translations that are wrong.
- Remove loading message enable/disable.  This feature is now handled in the library code.


2005-09-17  Version 1.2.3
-------------------------
- Update french translations
- Move translations off to seperate files for each locale.  enUS is the "default" locale as that is the locale I code with.
- Move localizations off to their own segments in the toc, this moves all static definitions out of the xml file.


2005-09-16  Version 1.2.2
-------------------------
- Modified taxiframe handling to operate via event handler and not hook the event function.
- Changed the logic behind the function that adds flight node information.
- Generate max POI numbers on the fly.  This allows for just updating the xml, or for blizzard to modify the max POI's in the main taxiframe xml.
- Using some blizzard defined strings for output rather than my own.  This allows for easier translation efforts.
- Modify known paths code to not require initialising.
- Cleanup of the FlightMapData.lua file.  Data will need to be erased on the client-side to cover for the update.
- Modification of init functions to be more localised for the various program segments.


2005-09-14  Version 1.2.1
-------------------------
- Correct issue with unknown flight times and the new remote flight timer code (Error in timer.lua).
- Correct issue where a route might be known, but not the flight time.  This removes unknown flight routes from the remote flight path code until the user learns the route.


2005-09-12  Version 1.2
-----------------------
- When a flight node is "reachable" add to known flightpaths... this might break things, I haven't tested this extensively.
- Position change of the in-flight timer to not obscure the zone name displays.
- Initial test setup for allowing for size change of the in-flight progress bar.
- Add option to display remote flight path times and costs.  Also display the path needed to fly there for that cost and time.
- Add size toggle for in-flight status bar large or a smaller bar.
- Update toc to 1700.


2005-09-09  Version 1.1
-------------------------
- Minor update to Localisations.
- Add myAddons to the optional dependancy list, just in case it was not loading after it, or the details where not working for it.
- Add status bar for in-flight timer, can be toggled off and on from the config menu.
- Modify zone map routine to write only when the zone map is opened, this should reduce the amount of processing the addon does.
- Random code-cleanup.
- Set load message to being active/not active by a variable... will add config option to modify variable in later releases.
- Translations cleanup - removed large chunks of the help message now the GUI config screen is here.


2005-09-05  Version 1.0
-----------------------
- Add in the missing data for Chillwind Camp and Light's Hope Chapel for the map translation data.
- Add in the GUI options screen.  Access via /efm config.
- Add per-character flight map display.
- Split flightmaster display functions off to FlightMaster.lua to finalise segmentation effort for program.
- French and German translations lacking at this time.  Hopefully the data can be brought up to date before the next release.


2005-09-05  Version 0.9.8
-------------------------
- Data definitions now locale-specific.  Until naming data and the EFM_MapTranslation data are provided to me, those on locales other than enUS will not be able to load any base data.
- Update zone map tooltip so the timers align under each other (approximately, the proportional font makes that a touch difficult).
- Alliance data for Kalimdor on enUS completed.
- Horde data for Azeroth on enUS completed.
- Horde data for Kalimdor on enUS completed.
- Alliance data for Azeroth on enUS completed.
- Alliance data for Kalimdor on enUS completed.
- Druid data on enUS completed.
- Add MapNotes to optional dependancy to attempt to force EFM to load after MapNotes so the worldmapbutton_onupdate routine is not overwritten.
- Added option to force data clearing on load.  This is to allow me to correct for bad data in the base data store.
- Corrected Data handling routine definition issue.


2005-09-04  Version 0.9.7
-------------------------
- German translation updated by Elkano at curse-gaming.
- Additional data for US horde data set.
- Discovered issue with duration and cost not aligning correctly.  Blizzard uses a proportional font for the tooltip text, so alignment of multiple lines of differents chars is difficult.  Text alignment is now as close as can be done without modifying the tooltip font.
- Modified layer alignment for the zone marker buttons.  This appears to have resolved the mapnotes gathering issue.
- Moved the data handling routines (clearing/loading/validating/definining) off to a seperate file for tracking ease.


2005-09-01  Version 0.9.6
-------------------------
- Correct init routine to call "define" for options, not defaults.
- Hide timer display if disabled in flight.
- Corrected german slash commands (maybe...), replaced uppercase characters with lowercase characters.
- Move to newer library standard.
- Correct issue with ui reload causing zone marker to disappear.


2005-08-31  Version 0.9.5
-------------------------
- Configuration variables are now saved between sessions.  Variables are global, not per-character.
- Add option to hide the druid flight paths if not desired to be shown.


2005-08-30  Version 0.9.4
-------------------------
- Correct Data loading issue.
- Add option to enable/disable flight master positions on zone map.
- Add option to enable/disable in-flight timers.
- Moved options handling to a seperate lua file.
- Convert colour codes in help to use the library defined codes.


2005-08-28  Version 0.9.3
-------------------------
- Correct correction for flight master mouse-over bug... next time I should check what was working previously...


2005-08-28  Version 0.9.2
-------------------------
- Correct issue with visiting a flight master but not "mousing over" any of the flight paths.

------------------------------
- Clean up some function calls, removal of old code.


2005-08-26  Version 0.9 Beta 4
------------------------------
- Undid change to data generation system that was put in place by previous betas.  All variables are now checked and pre-built in their respective init routines.


2005-08-26  Version 0.9 Beta 3
------------------------------
- Add available flight paths, with duration and cost to the map tooltip.
- Correct clearing issue with new variables.


2005-08-26  Version 0.9 Beta 2
------------------------------
- Correct incorrect naming of icon for grey flight master image.
- Correct issue with logging in in the middle of a flight.


2005-08-25  Version 0.9 Beta
----------------------------
- Add flight path timers.  Due to the change to the blizzard code in 1.7, split timers from base path to make the code simpler and the data easier to update.
- Added recording of flight costs.
- Added recording of flight master positions.
- Added zone to flight master translations (Yellow = Known by player, Grey = not known by player. Addon collect this data after install, so you need to visit for it to show yellow). 
- Added display of the flight master location to the map screen.
- Added some french translation data, thanks to corwin from curse-gaming.
- Added recording of known flight masters on a per-player basis.


2005-08-22  Version 0.8
-----------------------
- Correct issue with data update routines.
- Update alliance flight paths with additional data, thanks to those that supplied the additional data.


2005-08-11  Version 0.7
-----------------------
- Correct line drawing when the line was less than a pixel wide, this was evident from the splintertree to crossroads flightpath and others.
- Increase number of possible flightpath lines to 100, this should never need to get changed as the maximum number I have seen so far is 28.
- Correct data loading issue for horde/alliance/druid flightpath data.


2005-07-29  Version 0.6
-----------------------
- Code cleanup
- Correct line drawing display.  Blizzard appears to have changed the texture levels of various frames between 1.5 and 1.6...


2005-07-12  Version 0.5
-----------------------
- Update to new Blizzard LUA revision
- Add "easter-egg"... If you have the right things, you'll see it :-)


2005-06-29  Version 0.4
-----------------------
- Correct oops with data load names and variable naming.


2005-06-29  Version 0.3
-----------------------
- Corrected issue with new flight nodes not showing that you have found new routes.
- Modified data import routines to only import the data segments you desires, eg. horde/alliance/druid.


2005-06-28  Version 0.2
-----------------------
- Added the "learning" features for flight paths.
- Made the dataset be a loadable set, and not force loading of the data.
- Data loading from the provided data is a merge process (thanks Iriel).


2005-06-27  Version 0.1
-----------------------
- Initial Public Release
- Addon has most of the features I hope to include, hopefully only bug fixes will need to be done in the future
