If you're trying to run a vast mercantile empire like mine, you may occasionally find yourself (or your agents) losing track of all the stuff you're supposed to be looking for... Does your alchemist need Kingsblood today or does he need the other stuff to mix it with? How's your blacksmith doing on gems? Sure, you could go ask them or send a mail, but that takes precious time.

With this handy gadget, your auction agent can easily stay on top of all your material needs. If you're also using Auctioneer, it can even help make sure he knows when there's a good deal and when to wait for one.

------------------------------------------------------

INSTALLATION: Put this folder into your World Of Warcraft/Interface/AddOns folder and launch WoW.

USAGE: ShoppingList provides a few slash commands allowing you to maintain a list of items you're interested in, shared among all your characters on each realm. (See below for details.) Then, if you're also using Auctioneer, you can get a report showing whether any of the items you're looking for are currently available at auction and whether the current prices are a "good deal". By default, this report appears automatically when an auction scan finishes.

CHAT COMMANDS:
	/shoppinglist (or /sl) <command>
where <command> can be any of the following:
	help - Print this list.
	add <item link> - Shift-click one or more items to add it to the list.
	remove <item link> - remove one or more items from the list.
	list - show the list.
	report - list the cheapest auctions (from the latest AH scan) for the items on your list.
