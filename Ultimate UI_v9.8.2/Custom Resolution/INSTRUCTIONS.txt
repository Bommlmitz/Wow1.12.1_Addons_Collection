Set Up Your Style!
============
First, pick the folder that matches the style you want to use. Then, inside that folder pick the folder that corresponds to your in-game resolution. It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you setup your ingame resolution and UI scale to the appropriate values BEFORE you load the game for the first time with UUI installed. I.E. Before you put these files into your Addons folder, login to the game, set your UI scale to 80% and resolution to the resolution you want to use for the style. Check the individual style folders for the supported resolutions.

Further installation instructions are in their respective folders.

Please note: YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DO ANYTHING WITH THE FILES IN THIS FOLDER IF YOU PLAN TO PLAY WOW AT 1280x1024 OR 1024x768 RESOLUTION (Undead style)! THOSE FILES ARE ALREADY THERE BY DEFAULT.
