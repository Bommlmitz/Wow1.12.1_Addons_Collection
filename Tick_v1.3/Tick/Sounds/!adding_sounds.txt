You can add you own sounds to Tick, in case you don't like any of the supplied sounds, or simply wish to use your own sound. To add you own sound, you need to edit the main file which is "config.lua". We'll just quickly run through adding your own sounds, whether it be sounds that are already in the game or sounds that you made/downloaded and want to use. When you add a sound, you need to log out and completely restart Warcraft for the sound to be recognised and loaded.

NOTE: The custom non-game sound you want can only be a .wav or .mp3 file, nothing else is supported by Warcraft as far as I know.

ADDING A CUSTOM SOUND
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Place your sound file in the \Tick\Sounds\ folder.
2. Open config.lua in the main \Tick\ folder
3. Near the very top of the file, is an "array" called: Tick_SoundArr
4. To add a new file, you need to type the following:

[X] = "Interface\\AddOns\\Tick\\Sounds\\MySoundFile.ext",

Replace X with the next number available, by default Tick uses 10 sounds, so 11 would be the next available number. Make sure you type it perfectly as above, paying particular attention to the path of the sound itself. The two \\ are intended, as the escape character in LUA (just like PHP) is \  so you need to do two to make it use the \ character. Replace "MySoundFile.ext" with the name of your sound file and the extension, so if you file is called "bleep.wav" and the next number was 17, you need to add:

[17] = "Interface\\AddOns\\Tick\\Sounds\\bleep.wav",

into the array. Make sure it's all type correctly and make 100% sure you have included the comma at the end of line as this is ended to break the array up and move onto the next line.


ADDING AN EXISTING WARCRAFT SOUND
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Browse to: http://www.wowwiki.com/API_PlaySound
2. Pick a sound from the list, and in game to listen to it type: /script PlaySound("soundname");
3. If you like the sound and want to add it to the mod, you need to edit the "config.lua" file, so open it.
4. At the top of the file is an "array" called: Tick_SoundArr
5. To add the file, you need to type the following:

[X] = "NAMEOFSOUND",

Replace X with the next number available, by default Tick uses 10 sounds, so 11 would be the next available number. Replace "NAMEOFSOUND" with the sound you selected from the URL provided in Step 1. Make sure you type the line exactly as above but obvioulsy replacing the NAMEOFSOUND with the one you wanted, make sure also you include the comma at the end of the line and that the name of the sound is surrounded by quotes ( " symbols). As an example if I wanted to use the sound "PVPENTERQUEUE", I'd type the following:

[17] = "PVPENTERQUEUE",

Note that the filename IS case sensitive, so type is exactly as specified on the site listed in Step 1. And obviously use the next number available as mentioned, this may not be 17 if you have already added new sounds.
