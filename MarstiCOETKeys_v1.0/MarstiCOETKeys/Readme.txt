Call of Elements Totem Keys by Marsti - v1.0
============================================

This addon makes it possible to bind a key to the different totem bars of Call of Elements and keys for the bar entries (1 to 7). This is usefull for flex bars. For example you made following settings in the keybindings:

- Fire totems: CTRL-1
- Totem 1: CTRL-5
- Totem 2: CTRL-6

Now you want to throw the first fire totem. So you press CTRL-1 and CTRL-5 and your totem will be thrown. If you want to cast now totem 2 of the same element you can just press CTRL-6.

So you don't need to waste dozens of keybindings for all these totems.
