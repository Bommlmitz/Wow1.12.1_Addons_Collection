QuickLoot Plus by Joel Senecal-Phinn.

First of all I would like to thank you for downloading QuickLoot Plus.
This is my first WoW AddOn and I thought I would try to get the more important
aspects right on the first attempt. I am constantly learning more effeciant ways to
code in Lua, so i'm sure there will be a couple updates to this AddOn in the near future.
One of wich will be the support for Localization, my initial realease was strictly
in english and seeing as so many different people play World of WarCraft, this feature is
a must. There are many AddOns for WoW, many of wich are done in a "sloppy" way without any GUI
what so ever, those that do have GUI's are sometimes very incoheirent, wich fustrates me. I take
my AddOns very seriously even if it's as simple as this one, they should all be user friendly
to improve the general enjoyability of World of WarCraft.

If there's a loot feature you would like to see implemented or you would like to take part of 
the localization, don't be shy, you can contact me at Senecal_AddOns@hotmail.com. 
We're a community and we should help each other out. :)

Also, if you run into any bugs reguarding my AddOn, please email me with the following information.
- Proof that it is my AddOn causing the error, in the form of a screenshot.
- A list of AddOns you are currently using.

Thanks!
