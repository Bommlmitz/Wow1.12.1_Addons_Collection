The Addon BarTracker logs the changes of the health and mana/rage/energy bars, and logs them. After a fight, it draws a diagram. It's movable (shift click) and resizable (alt click), and can show a tooltip with additional statistics. Some commands can be reached with the right click menu. More commands are available with the /bartracker slash command:

    * /bartracker show [on|off]
    * /bartracker scale <num>
    * /bartracker timescale <num>, auto when 0
    * /bartracker timeout <num>
    * /bartracker combatlog [on|off]
    * /bartracker load <numame>
    * /bartracker store <numame>
    * /bartracker list
    * /bartracker delete <numame>
    * /bartracker start
    * /bartracker pause
