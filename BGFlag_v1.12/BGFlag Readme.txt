This mod is used for the Warsong Gulch Battleground.
It was imagined and created by Thamos of Dalaran.

BGFlag is a simple mod that shows the name of the flag carrier next to the score display in WSG.  If the flag is not being held, it will either say "dropped" or "At Base", and I'm sure you can guess what that means.

BGFlag has basic slash commands, as follows (a simple help can also be viewed in game by typing /bgflag)

/bgflag disable - Obvious
/bgflag enable - More Obvious
/bgflag clear - Sometimes mostly due to unknown reasons (but also due to reloading the UI in the middle of a WSG or possibly some other mods) the Flag carrier status will be incorrect, use this to clear it; when the next status is shouted by the Herald, it will update correctly.
/bgflag unlock - This unlocks the score display, and shows a little anchor icon which you can drag to customize your score position.
/bgflag lock - Locks the score display so it won't be moved...
/bgflag reset - The score screen may sometimes be lost or moved to a bad spot (sometimes by other mods).  Use this to move the frame to its original position.

-Features-
  Displays the status of each flag ("At Base", "dropped", or the carriers name)
  Allows for movement of the score frame (and saved position thru sessions)
  When you click on the carriers name it will target them (eg: useful for Mind Vision)
  Keybindings for Target Friendly and Target Hostile flag carriers

-Known "Problems"-
  When attempting to target an opposing faction member, if you are not in range, it obviously cannot target them.
  On first use, the score display may be out of place: use /bgflag reset and it will (should) be fixed from then on.
