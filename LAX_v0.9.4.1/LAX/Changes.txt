0.9.4.1

- Minor fix for 0.9.4 had some variables fucked up.

0.9.4

- Added "time to level","xp / hour" and "session time".
- This seems to work for me, I just finished all the stuff today while in SM.
- It is all shown in the tooltip and not on the actualt bartext.

0.9.3

- Added French translation by Rask or rather French support.
- Not sure if it works though, I do not have a French client.

0.9.2

- Fix since 0.9.1 was still broken.
- Sorry about this but it wouldnt show on my chars, saw it when I created a new one.

0.9.1

- Fixed some help typos and such, rewrote basically all text that explains
  how LAX works.
- Added a basic recalculation of the number of kills needed when you have
  rested XP bonus, basically devided the regular number by 2.
  It is rough but its more accurate then before.

0.9

- Added docking support once again.
- Made LAX always ontop so that docking wouldnt look weird.

0.8.9

- Added 3 more locations of the tooltip, top, bottom and above.
  Above will float "over" the LAX bar.
  Bottom will attach to the bottom if you have LAX all the way up.
  Top is for showing the tooltip on the top of LAX.
- Added support for non saving mode, LAX will now check before saving the
  kill/xp history.
- Added debug toggle command.
- Minor cosmetical fixes.
- Minor code checkup and fixing.

0.8.8

- Added 3 ways of showing the XP left to level.
  /lax xptext normal|togo|bars
  normal: the standard LAX way and AvgXP way, showing XP gained on level.
  togo: AvgXP Plus style, showing XP left to level.
  bars: Shows it as 20 bars max, aka 14 bars to level or so.
- Added more Experience information to the tooltip, all of the 3 xptext modes
  now show in the tooltip when nothing is targeted.
- Looked at the init code and fixed a bug where you would reset all settings
  for your characters if you logged into a new realm.

0.8.7.1

- Fixed a minor error with /lax text hover option and it still showing when
  you logged in until you had moved your mouse over it once.
- Added 20 Bars Meter to the tooltip so people can see how man bars out of 20 
  they have left to level.

0.8.7

- Added a no text option since Ven on Curse-Gamin requested it.
  /lax text show, hide or hover (hover will hide it but show it on mouseover)
- Also added off option to /lax tooltip so that if you want you can hide it.

0.8.6

- Added possibility to change colour of the MainXP bar, recoded /lax colour to
  just show help for /lax mcolour and /lax rcolour (r for rested m for main)
  Note that only /lax mcolour default can be used to set the main XP bar back
  to blue colour, blue is not possible with the Rested bar.
- Added /lax font to set the fontsize of LAX.
- Added /lax width to set the width of LAX, this kicks in if briefmode is turned
  off with /lax brief off (else brief mode will overrun width)
- Removed command to spam /lax level to raid and #, I dont want people spamming 
  the channels with something I created, I just dont support spam.
  Guild and Party still works.

0.8.5.3

- Added /lax hide to the saved settings so you may now as 60 choose to have
  LAX auto hidden for your specific character or not. Well any char can choose
  so if you have a char just for AH scouting heck that char can hide it aswell.
- Added variable for the future release of DisableSave mode.
  I scanned through the avgxp code and well it will take some time to make 
  the none data saving LAX come through but I will look at it.
- Planned more functions to /lax reset, /lax reset now is the first to come
  then more will come for example /lax reset onload (auto reset).
  (Heck I actually added onload in 0.8.5.3 to disable use /lax reset disable)
  Note that all kill data is removed when you do /lax reset now.
- Thinking still about how to impliment the KIllLog data into LAX, this might be
  close to impossible or atleast demanding insane amount of coding but I will
  however still look at it.

0.8.5.2

- When loading LAX to a completely new Character it would bug out and fail 
  to load properly, this has been fixed now.
- /lax reset is now actually resetting all the kill, depkill and xp history, 
  a note is that it will only be reset for the current Character.

0.8.5.1

- Minor BriefMode error fix (0.8.5 broke it)
- Backed out of the DisableSave functions that I did in 0.8.5 
  (I missunderstood the idea)
- Minor Cosmetics.

0.8.5

- LAX_LoadOptions had some serious faults in 0.8.4.1 so players that
  was totally new to LAX wouldnt get the correct settings.
- Added the first test support for DisableSave, more about this in
  the lua file.
- Minor typo fixes.

0.8.4.1

- Minor type fixes from 0.8.4
  Thanks to Melavius for the help on all this.

0.8.4

- 0.8.3 broke the /lax brief support, so I fixed it.

0.8.3

- Added support for settings to save for Realm & Character.
  This made it possible to have diff settings for diff chars.
- Added more German support.

0.8.2

- I broke /lax unlock in 0.8.1 so this fixes it.
- Added /lax tooltip to /lax help.

0.8.1

- Added tooltip options.
  /lax tooltip left|right 
  This would put the tooltip either on left or right side of LAX.
- Addressed more German client errors.
- Rewrote changes.txt (very important <grin>)

0.8 

- Introduced brief mode.
  /lax brief on|off
  Will set the LAX bar to either 560 (default) or 380 (brief) width.
- Addressed some stuff that would make LAX fail on German clients.
