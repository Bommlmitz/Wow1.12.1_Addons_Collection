Ding Recorder 2.0 - English only
===================================

DESCRIPTION
=============
Ding recorder is a very simple addon that will attempt to capture a screenshot automaticly when you level (ding) a character. this will utilize the built in Screenshot function in WoW. The files will be saved in the '\screenshots' folder in your WoW directory. You can then convert them to .jpg using a 3rd party program. 

Features include options to Show or hide your interface for the screenshot, and to send a message to guild chat to notify them of your ding. 


COMMANDS
===============
Use /dr to check status and for help
/dr guildnotify - enable guild notify
/dr noguildnotify - disable guild notify
/dr showint - Show interface in screenshot
/dr hideint - Hide interface in screenshot
/dr showconfig - displays in chat window your current settings for Ding Recorder.


HELP WANTED
=============
If you would like to help me out with a UI screen to set the settings, I would greatly appreciate it! all credit will be given. 


KNOWN ISSUES
=============
If you have setting to hide interface, you may not know which level you were at as there is no indicator of your level. So unless you have a great memory or install this from lvl1, I recomend finding and renaming files as soon as possible.
