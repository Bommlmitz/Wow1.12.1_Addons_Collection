Author's Notes
--------------
Thank you for trying out my Addon, I'm really shocked by the amount of people who have tried it in just a few days. I initially made this Addon for myself, but was persuaded to post it to Curse-Gaming in order to get feedback. To that end, I would ask that if you have any feedback at all, even negative feedback, please get that to me, and I will take all comments into consideration either for this Addon, or another.

I can be reached on AIM at thesnarky1, via email at snarky@thesnarky.com, or you can leave a comment or private message through Curse-Gaming (http://www.curse-gaming.com). 


Installation
------------
Unpack the zip file right into your World of Warcraft\Interface\Addons\ directory, and you should be good to go if there's now a directory called Profession_Helper.  


How to Use
----------
To open the Profession Helper window, use the slash commands "/ph" and "/profession_helper". The Profession Helper window that opens has a few lines. Item displays the item that you'll be dealing with. To choose a new item, highlight it on the appropriate crafting/tradeskill window, and click the refresh button on the right hand side. The next line is Amount, where you move the slider to choose the amount of stacks you'd like to make. The number you have selected is displayed on the righthand side. The send to row has a drop down box where you choose whom to send the mats to. If it's to guild or party, merely select them and hit "Send". If its to a player or channel, select that, then type the name of the player or channel in the box to the right before hitting "Send". 


Translations
------------
I'm more than happy to translate this addon for any language you want. However, since I don't speak every language, it'll fall on the part of a native speaker to submit that translation. This is not a big deal, just send me a file that says "Here's how you say X in Y"... For instance "Send to Guild, Send to party, etc". I'd love to get more supported languages, so if you want to see this in your native tongue, take the initiative and mail it to me! It should be easy to look at the localization files provided and copy them for your language.

You'll notice some words aren't translated to your language yet. Please send me the correct translation, and it will be included in the next release.

Warnings
--------
If you screw up your system, or anything bad happens, I am in no way responsible. By this I don't mean it'll break your system, but have to put it on there so I don't get a deluge of demands for me to fix people's systems. 

Screenshots
-----------
I'm always looking for screenshots of this in action. If you like it, and want to see yourself up on the page, please send me a screenshot and it'll be included.

Bugs
----
There appears to be a weird bug that occasionally makes me unable to interact in the environment after doing SOMETHING with PH. Not sure what that is, any reports of it would be great, thanks.

Thanks
------
I need to thank all those who have contributed localizations for this mod. Aphelandra was the first to step up and translate with no request from me. LaMaG provided the French translation as well as breaking the localization out into seperate files for each language. Finally those people who have provided feedback on the curse-gaming comment section with regards to if it works with X language, if Y feature works... I need that testing, thanks so much for providing it.
