4.5:

--> Hunters feigning will be ignored.


4.4:

--> Improved target selection implementation. Now 0 lag. The mod can only pick targets in your raid group. Should get pets too though.

--> Bumped the frame strata one notch to stop the menu getting occluded so much.


4.2:

--> the mod should no longer cause your target to change.

--> Targets who are further than 100 yards away were causing the mod to do nothing if they were the highest priority.

--> Added a minimum heal parameter to the macro. e.g
	/script klhms.main.execute("Heal", "target", 1500)
will cast a rank of Heal or Greater Heal on your target, and pick a rank with at least 1500 expected heal. Note that if this parameter is supplied it will override the MinimumHeal setting in the Spell Selection section of the Menu.

--> It's now possible to heal a target outside your party / raid, if you have the "target" parameter in your macro and select them. The target health bar will be inaccurate so you'll just have to ignore it.

--> Added Randomisation menu section in target selection.


3.3:

--> Sparse Tutorial available in the "Tutorial" section of the Menu.

--> Automatic target selection available. Change the behaviour in the "Target Selection" section of the menu, and also the macro.

--> You can force the spell to be used:
1) Default long spell:
	/script klhms.main.execute()

2) Flash Heal only:
	/script klhms.main.execute("Flash Heal")

3) Heal / Greater Heal only:
	/script klhms.main.execute("Heal")


--> Added second parameter to klhms.main.execute. If it is the value "target", you will only heal your current target. e.g. 
	/script klhms.main.execute(nil, "target") 
or
	/script klhms.main.execute("Heal", "target")

--> Added heaps of stuff to the help menu. Just heaps.

--> Extended the minimum level of spells to 10. We'll need a better solution to this later, e.g. don't downrank if it decreases damage per mana.

--> The text on the top left of the player cast bar now shows the efficiency of the casting spell, colour coded to indicate whether it is considered cancellable.


2.6:

Since this is the first version, i'll just list some features instead!

--> On high latency connections, the mod can significantly speed up your effective casting time. With 500ms ping, a 2.5 cast will really take 3 second when chain casting. With the mod running you can easily reduce this to 2.6 or 2.7 seconds, a good 10% dps increase.

--> The mod also takes into account graphical latency, by drawing your casting bar as it will appear in the future. So if your fps dives to 5 in a graphics intensive encounter, you won't have to click the macro in advance to get it to work properly.

--> Run the command  /kms  to show the help window. Currently you can adjust the parameters that determine which rank of your healing spells to cast. It's (hopefully) self explanatory.

--> Mortal Strike, Mortal Wound, Blessing of Light buffs on target are incorporated. (No healing way yet - coming soon!)

--> If you have the BonusScanner mod installed, +healing gear and +spell crit gear is incorporated. (No set bonuses yet)

--> Running the macro will cast the primary long cast spell for your class (Healing Touch, Healing Wave, (Greater) Heal, Holy Light.

--> For Mod authors: the code is designed to be as easy as possible to borrow from. The string "KLHManaStorm" only exists in 1) The .toc file (twice), 2) Globals.lua (once). The GUI is made without using XML, so none of the GUI components occupy the global namespace. The mod has only two variables in the global namespace: 1) klhmssavedvariables, which is referenced in the .toc file, and Globals.lua, 2) klhms, which is reference only in LoadFirst.lua. Feel free to copy any code of interest (but please give credit where it's due). In particular the code in the Framework folder is almost all you need to get a new mod started.
