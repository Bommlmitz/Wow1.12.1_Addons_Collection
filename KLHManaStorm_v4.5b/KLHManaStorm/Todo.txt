--> "Aggro" section in target selection

--> Use incoming dps / incoming healps for target / spell selection

--> make stuff movable

--> add friends list for target selection

	--> Here's a good method from notes. We store all our friends in a combo box, which has their name and weight. If you select someone it will make them the active player, where you can change their weighting or delete them.!!

--> when chain casting, take into account expected current heal. This is important!

--> flash heal 7 then casting alterate spell == lua error my.lua 417 ish. (min heal was >= rank 7 value)

--> Minimap icon (innervate texture)

--> menu entry for diagnostics. We want to see the time taken and memory taken to load the code (loadfirst can generate initial time / memory points). Also time taken and memory from OnLoad(), for a total memory and proc output. Then Module by Module breakdown. OnEvent breakdown by actual events. OnUpdate broken into methods. Ownage!

--> for shits and giggles, eliminate klhms from the global namespace?

--> LOS Blacklist to Target Selection:

	--> Instead of yes/no, we make it a multiplier! Starts at 0, goes up to 1 over time! A parabola of the form y = a * x^2 looks good.
	
	--> Also have linear backoff after multipler LOS's

	--> If LOS on one person fails, back the other LOS people off. Ditto with succeeds, but need different amounts.

--> Make pets targettable by the mod
