TOOLTIP WRANGLER SHOULD BE COMPATIBLE WITH ALL VERSIONS, PLEASE TELL ME IF IT'S NOT
NEED TRANSLATIONS

Hi Thomas…
Unfortunately, I gave up writing addons.  Don’t have enough time to do both and I would rather play.  Please feel free to continue the TTW addon by publishing your version… Sounds like great work.
Regards,
Ken

So hence, this is a continuation of Tooltip Wrangler found http://www.curse-gaming.com/en/wow/addons-646-1-tooltip-wrangler-108.html

Tooltip Wrangler allows the user as much control as possible to position the tooltip where they want it.
The tooltip can be attached to the mouse, any available frame in the game, or the provided crosshairs.  It is also possible to attach the tooltip to most mouseover buttons and widgets.
Offsets can be used to give more fine control over the position of the tooltip, and it is possible to anchor the tooltip by any of its nine cardinal points.
Possible Anchors are:
TOP
TOPLEFT
TOPRIGHT
BOTTOM
BOTTOMLEFT
BOTTOMRIGHT
LEFT
RIGHT
CENTER
