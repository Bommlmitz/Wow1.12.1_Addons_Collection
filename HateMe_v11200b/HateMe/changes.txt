Changes : 

Upcoming
========
= Need to skip Shout abilities if the player is silenced. I need people to collect silenced debuff names. As I get them I will implement this.
= Add a command to allow feral fairy fire to be used even if the enemy has the buff already. Need someone to volunteer to test this, or I have to wait until my druid get's the ability.
= add option to turn off Bloodrage
= integrate the German translations people have provided
= add option to use Demo Shout for HateYou. Will automatically add Onyxia to the immune list.
= add option to not taunt off of warriors and druids in bear form

11200b
======
= Changed a lot of things for druids. Please see druid section of the description for the new logic.
= Put in a couple temp immunity checks specifically for Hamstring
= Added an temp immunity for Charlga Razorflank in RFK. Never did find out what the name of that paly bubble-like buff is called, so I'm just checking if it's her.
= Put shield slam in the defensive logic... sorry, it should have been there to begin with.

11200a
======
= Updated TOC
= Made the runners check for hamstring compatible with the new WoW version.

11000c
======
= Made this mod compatable with KLM_ThreatMeter. I do not use KLM_ThreatMeter so there are no guarantees.
= Fixed bugs with Execute and the Immune check. Really it's fixed this time. I've tested it and everything.
= Added the option to turn on and off Battle Shout optimization.

11000b
======
= Fixed bugs with the GUI.
= Fixed bugs with using hateme or hateyou as a macro.

11000a
======
= Created a GUI
= Fixed the bug where you could only set Execute bonus rage as low as 1.
= Fixed the bug where an error came up when encountering a mob who is immune when you are not playing a warrior or a druid.
= Changed the rules for using Rend. See new description for details.
= Reorganized the code.

1900.8e
=======
= Emergency fix for the immunity checks. It seems they weren't working at all.

1900.8d
=======
= Streamlined the code for immunity checks.
= Added paladin's bubble to the temp immunities. UNTESTED! Please let me know if it works or not.
= Added command to turn on and off immunity checks.
= This version will delete all old immunities.
= Fixed the fact that not all of the shield based spells were checking if there was a shield equiped.
= Changed the hs betweeen/after command to only affect HateMe and not HateYou.

1900.8c
=======
= Added Berserker Rage to the logic.
= Disabled immunity checks for PVP.
= Fixed HateMe for use with test realms. Confirmed that fix is backwards compatable.

1900.8b
=======
= Added slash command for HateYou. Made all setting commands work for both /hateme and /hateyou.
= Put the command to turn rend on and off back in.
= Changeed Battle Shout in HateYou to check that it will not cause too much threat. In HateMe I used 11.11 yds for determining distance when I wanted to make sure enough would be affected to repeat the command. I used the same range for HateYou. If this doesn't do the job I can change it to 30 yds in the future.
= Added a command to turn Taunt on and off.
= Changed Mortal Strike to be used whenever possible instead of just when the mob doesn't have the debuff.

1900.8a
=======
Lotsa changes in this version!
= Added a setting to set a minimum rage for execute.
= Added a HateYou button!
= Moved Rend to HateYou, so removed the setting to turn it on and off in HateMe.
= Added logic for Hamstring based off of mobs that have attempted to flee in the past.
= Added the information about mobs who have attempted to flee to the clear command.
= Lowered the lag variable so the next action will be executed faster.
= Added logic to check how many units Battle Shout will affect. I am checking 11.11 yds rather than 20 yds due to scripting limitations.
= Updated mod description to reflect all the changes.

1900.7
======
= Raised the priority of Taunt.
= Changed the rend default to off so that the default logic generates the most hate.
= Added Shield Slam to the logic. It goes off only if you have enough rage, otherwise it does sunder or HS.
= Disabled HateMe (to save on rage) and immunity detection when the mob is banished.


1900.6
======
= Fixed immunity check bug that caused it to report things out of the control of the HateMe mod. I recommend clearing the immunities you have collected so far.
= Added a command to clear the saved immunities.
= Added a test command to show what abilities it is casting.
= For some reason, Bloodrage was set to go off until player's health reached 15%. Put this back to the 50% that is listed in the description.

1900.5
======
= Added a command to choose whether to do heroic strike when sunder is on cooldown.

1900.4
======
= Added a command to sunder after 5 sunders.
= Whoops.. forgot to change the version # inside the program. I fixed it and re-uploaded this version when I uploaded 1900.5. There was 100 downloads before I did that, if you're the type who cares about that sorta thing.

1900.3
======
= Changed the logic to use Overpower before Execute because Execute uses all remaining rage. When tanking you are often fighting more than one enemy. It did not seem ideal to loose all your rage when you still had to deal with the rest of the targets when you could have used Overpower instead.

1900.2
======
= Fixed shield block.
= Added Rend to the logic.
= Added the ability for Hateme to remember who Rend is immune to. (thanks MarkParish for putting me in the right direction)
= Added the ability to turn Rend on and off.

1900.1 (Greg "OverloadUT" Laabs)
======
= Updated TOC to 1.9

1800.1 (Greg "OverloadUT" Laabs)
======
= Updated to work with interface 1800.
= The Sunder logic now uses the built in method for determining how many Sunders are active on a target.
