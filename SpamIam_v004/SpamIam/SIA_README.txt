Playing WoW involves the 'spamming' of certain actions.  Unfortunately the game does not like 'button mashing' and lets you know it, by printing a text message on screen or by an audible speech message.  "That Ability is not ready yet", "I can't do that yet", etc etc.

===Changes from v003 -> v004===
--> Fixed line 70 error (SpamIam does not need Ace)
--> Added German speech translation (thx Leialyn)
--> Updated version info
