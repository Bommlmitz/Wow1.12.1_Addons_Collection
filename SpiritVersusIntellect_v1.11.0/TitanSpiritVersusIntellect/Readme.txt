Titan Spirit Versus Intellect v1.11.0 by Ted Vessenes (tedvessenes@gmail.com).

-------------------------------------

This is a titan plugin to display data computed by SpirtVersusIntellect.
You will need to install Titan to use this display.  The title bar will
output a series of numbers on which looks something like this:

  100%  I: 15.0  S: 0.0  M: 0.0 

The first number is your current mana regeneration rate (generally 100 when
you haven't recently cast and 0 when you have).  The next three numbers
represent how much mana each point of Intellect, Spirit, and Mana/5 have
provided through the last combat.  You can mouse over the panel to see the
equivalence relationships between each stat.  (For example, 1 spirit = 0.3
int and 1 mana/5 = 1.3 int.)

Note that these numbers just represent how much mana your spirit and mana/5
could have regenerated.  Its your responsibility to make sure your mana bar
isn't full so the regenerated mana isn't wasted.
