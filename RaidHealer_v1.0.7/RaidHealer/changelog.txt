- Assignements will be cleared correctly before automatic buff assignment.
- Events for health changes are no only registered when in raid (performance).
- Mana events will be registered only for druids and when in raid.

New: Innervate functions implemented within the info frame as follows.
	- druids will see a mana bar for the priest with the lowest mana in the raid with no Innervate buff
	- Right-Click on the bar will cast Innervate (checking cooldown and double-innervate), Left-Click will target
	- percentage of mana alert is configurable in steps of 5%.
	- configuration will be only visible if you play a druid.

Version 1.0.3 (2006-10-09)
--------------------------

- Option for alternate heal announcement (Tank <<< Healer1, Healer2 ...)
- Button for automatic buff assignment (assigns buffers to groups randomly, but preserves an order, so that the buffer has back-to-back groups). Couldn't test with all possible options. Also alway 8 groups will be assignde, so dont use in small raids ;-)

- Target bars will now hide if a healer has no assignment in the latest announce but had one before.

--------------------------
Version 1.0.0 (2006-09-30)
--------------------------

I think i got a running version with hopefully no serios bugs so i make this one a release version. all the funtions are described above.

--------------------------
Version 0.9.13 (2006-09-30)
--------------------------

fixes Interface/AddOns/RaidHealer/RaidHealer.lua:662: attempt to index field `?' (a nil value) headshot mentioned. you did nothing wrong, i did :/

--------------------------
Version 0.9.12 (2006-09-30)
--------------------------

- reset of buff and heal assignments should work now.

--------------------------
Version 0.9.10 (2006-09-30)
--------------------------

hopefully fixes the bugs headshot mentioned.

Version 0.9.9 (2006-09-29)
--------------------------

I hope it will not cause to much error's ;-) because i had to rewrite a bunch of functions. i had to change also the variables saved by the addon, so please if you receive error messages try first to delete all SavedVariable in WTF/Account/AccountName/SavedVariables AND WTF/Account/AccountName/ServerName/CharName/SavedVariables. Delete the files named RaidHealer.* but exit game before.

Now to the Features:

- CTRA MT's will be parsed realtime
- Buffing now for all major buffs except Paladin ... sry :/
- 2nd Announce button to announce only the selections on the current page (heal & buff) whispers will also be filtered by class / buff

Also i have implementet a Client-Serv-functionality.
Now, if you announce your assignments, player with the addon will get health bars for the assigned players (up to 5) click on the bar will target them or cast a waiting spell. to get the info window type /rh info, but by default it should be visible.

Please give comments to this function. i like this one very much but had tested ist only in a 2 person raid ;-) maybe if our server is up in the evening i can test it while bashing nef ^^

--------------------------
Version 0.9.6
--------------------------

- rework on faction recognition again. hopefully it works now.
- simple CTRA connection. MT1-9 will shown above tanks names which set as MT. (may be not refreshed in realtime. had no chance to test yet)
- Whisper answers worked over. Playes not in raid will get a proper answer as well as classes which cannot heal or buff.

--------------------------
Version 0.9.4
--------------------------

- generaly only layout optimization.
- using wow-internal class icons, so you may delete the classIcons folder

--------------------------
Version 0.9.2
--------------------------

- Updated faction recognition (maybe yo have to (de)select the third class once if you switch the faction)
- Buttons to clear assignments (i'd uploaded a debug version witch maybe caused the announcement of 'old' players, but this button should clear the assignments completly)
