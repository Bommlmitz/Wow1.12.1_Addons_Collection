--------------------
1. Action Prediction
--------------------
Panza provides a function ( PanzaWill() ) that will report on major actions that would be performed if an action key were pressed.

bool,unit = PanzaWill("Function");

Arguments: "function" required. "Function" must be "HEAL", "CURE", "BUFF", "FREE", "REZ", or "PANIC"

Returns true,unit if Panza will perform that action, or false,nil if that action would not occur. 
unit will be a unitid to use in PA:Best functions, or another addons own function that requires a unitid.
Do not use Panza's AutoSelect functions that pick targets. PanzaWill() will perform this task.

A Unit test is included on SVN to test the API function.

-----------
2. Tooltips
-----------
Panza provides a tooltip function that action bar addons may call to set tooltips for Panza Macros.

Panza_ActionButton_SetTooltip(MacroName)

Arguments - MacroName (action text for the button)

For example in FlexBars this is:

Panza_ActionButton_SetTooltip(GetActionText(FlexBarButton_GetID(button)));
