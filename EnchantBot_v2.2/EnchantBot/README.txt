----- Original ReadMe -----

You actually read the README! Congratulations. You are a unique person.

Q. What's new in this version?

A. You are now required to begin all search queries with the "search"
keyword and "reagents" for ingredients. This change is due to
some users whispering you with questions, and what not. Origionally
they would get an autoreply message saying they need to refine their
search. Examples:

get a list of all chest armor enchants:

/w revenger search chest 


get a list of reagents for recipe number one:

/w revenger reagents 1 



Q. How do you get this thing to work?

A. When you load WoW or reload the interface, you should see it says
EnchantBot loaded. By default, I don't remember and quite frankly I'm
too lazy to check, but I think it is off by default. Simply type
"/enchantbot" (or "/eb") to turn it on or off. Second most
importantly, the enchant window must be open for this to work. It
is quite annoying, and you can't really play the game while it is on.


Q. What license is this under?

A. Public domain.
