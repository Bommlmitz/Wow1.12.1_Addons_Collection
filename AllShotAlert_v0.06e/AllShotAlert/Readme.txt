++ GENERAL ++

AllShot Alert is the expansion of work done by a number of previous mods/coders (noted above).  Essentially, it pops up an alert on your screen every time your attack crits (because hey - who doesn't love a good crit?).  The initial version of the mod only alerted on Aimed Shot crits for hunters.  This version has been significantly updated and expanded to handle all attacks (I think?) in the game, across classes.  A few options have been added to make the mod  more customizeable and can be listed from the command prompt.  Plans in the future include adding more options and customizations to let end-users tweak more of the mod to their liking, a better UI, and more reporting/output options (at which point it may actually move to full v1.0 status!).

++ USAGE ++

Typing '/allsa' from the command prompt will bring up a list of options.  Once ALLSA is loaded, the default settings will need to be updated to enable messaging/sounds/etc. based on use preferences.  A limited GUI is available via '/allsa options'.
