v1.931
- Previously, when the Swiftmend Monitor was detecting rejuv and regrowth casts on a player that you had de-targeted, the switch target sound would play several times over the course of a second(This was AsmoMOD re-targeting the target to check for the cast to register).  Now, that sound has been removed.
