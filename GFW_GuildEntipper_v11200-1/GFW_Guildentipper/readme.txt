Sometimes, even a master goblin engineer like myself prefers a simple gizmo with a single function instead of those overcomplicated, Alterac Army-style contraptions that try to do everything. Sure, every vendor from here to the Hinterlands has some kind of gadget to help you identify other adventurers' guild tabards from a distance, or show you all sorts of info about them, in any color you prefer, while letting you hold it in either hand, upside down, whatever... but I don't need all that. And I trust my own handcrafted devices over someone else's any day! 

This little doohickey is good enough for me... maybe it's just what you need, too. (Of course, even the simplest gizmo needs a good name!)

INSTALLATION: Put this folder into your World Of Warcraft/Interface/AddOns folder and launch WoW.

USAGE: When mousing over a player in the world, the tooltip should show their guild name (in angle brackets) on the second line.
