To print recipe ingredients into chat window, chat window 
must be open to receive text (usually opens by hitting 
enter, "/r", "/g", etc.) and simply Alt-Left Mouse Click 
while the mouse is over the recipe icon in question.  The
materials needed are automatically sent to the chat window
specified by the open chat box.
ie
send materials to guild chat: 
open chat window with "enter", type "/g", then alt-click recipe icon

send materials to a reply:
open chat window with "enter", type "/r", then alt-click recipe icon

easy!

notes:
-1.9 marked the removal of the loader and a bug fix for the dressing room
-For 1.8 I had to add a loader for chatmats since the TradeSkill and Craft Frames are not loaded
until those windows are opened.  This should go away in 1.9.
-As of 1.3, all ingredients are now linked, but in different chat msgs.
This usually means recipes having more than 4 ingredients are put into
two different chat messages.
