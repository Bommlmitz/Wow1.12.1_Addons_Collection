Name: CashNotify

Desc: Provides text notifications of any cash gains or
      expenditures in the chat pane.

Ver#: 1.10.0

Note:

A small, simple AddOn that provides textual feedback when a
character gains or spends money, via the chat pane.

You no longer need to wonder exactly how much you just spent
on those 14 items you just bought from the merchant, or how
much you looted from a corpse (whilst ungrouped), as it's
right there for you to see!

Notifications are toggled on/off via various key-bindings or
by a simple '/cn' or '/cashnotify' slash-command, you can
change the colour of notifications (see '/cn ?' for full
syntax), which chat frame they'll be displayed in, whether
transactions you make at a merchant are individually
'itemised' or 'summarised' when you close the frame and your
settings are remembered for the next time you play.

Supports the 'myAddOns' addon (as an optional dependency).
