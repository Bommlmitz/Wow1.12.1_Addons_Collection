ChatrFilter Help

Lines not starting with I or O are disregarded.
The line format is as follows:
<Direction>:<Type>:<Match>:<Action>
Direction may be I (inbound) or O (outbound). Note that this is purely visual.
Type may be M (message), ML (message, lowercased) or N (name).
Match is a Lua pattern to match against.
Action may be
  i (ignore)
  s <pattern> (substitute with <pattern>)
  r <text> (replaces the entire message/name with text)

Examples
Filter "OMG" to "Oh gosh!": I:M:OMG:s Oh gosh!
Never show anything with "DKP" that is whispered to you: I:M:DKP:i
