v0.3.1 --------
Bug Fixes
- /easytab assist should now work properly.

v0.3 ----------
New Features
- Configuration GUI! Type /easytab config to open up the configuration panel. Most new options will be set here
	from now on, instead of through slash commands.
- Selective targetting! EasyTab now has options to ignore (skip) these targets in the config panel:
	- Hunter pets
	- Warlock pets
	- Crowd-controlled targets (sheep, sap, etc)
	- Targets that have been tapped by other players
Bug Fixes
- You should no longer end up with your MA targetted if he/she cannot be assisted and no enemies can be found.
- You should no longer assist your MA if he/she is targetting a corpse or dead player.
- Pressing the key bound to "Set/Clear Assist" will now clear your MA if you have yourself targetted (instead of
	setting your MA to yourself).
Misc. Changes
- Reworded "Assist Target" to "Main Assist" to avoid confusion and keep things in line with standard WoW lingo.
- Lowered the default blacklist duration to 2 seconds.
- Reworked how the mod handles saved variables. Blacklist duration will be reset to the new default value.
Notes
- Priority is still given to the MA target over selective targetting - ie: if your MA has a sheeped mob targetted,
	you will assist them. I plan to allow players to set their own priorities in a future release, but in the
	meantime, make sure your MA isn't targetting stuff they shouldn't be (or tell them to get EasyTab! =P)

v0.2 ----------
New Features
- EasyTab will now detect when your Assist Target cannot be located, and stop trying to assist them for a short
	duration of time. The duration can be changed with /easytab blacklist. See the readme.txt for more info.
Bug Fixes
- Fixed an error that could cause the mod to "lock on" to one target and not cycle through others.
