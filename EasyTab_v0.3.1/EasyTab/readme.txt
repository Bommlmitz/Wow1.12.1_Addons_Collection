EasyTab v0.3.1 - Intelligent tab-targetting addon
by Sledge, US-Eredar

INSTALLATION:
Simply unzip all files into your World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns directory. Make sure your unzip
utility is set to use folder names.

SETUP:
Once logged in, go into your Keybindings menu and find the EasyTab section. Bind a key to "Find Target"
(I'd suggest the Tab key :P). You can also bind another key to set or clear your Main Assist here.
You will also want to open the configuration panel with /easytab config and set the desired options
there.

USAGE:
(Note: any of the following can be used in place of /easytab below: /et, /etab, /eztab)
/easytab config : Open the configuration panel (Most other slash commands are also handled through here).
/easytab assist : Sets your Main Assist to the currently selected player. If no player is selected, 
	this will display your current Main Assist.
/easytab assist <player> : Sets your Main Assist to <player>.
/easytab clear : Clears the Main Assist.
/easytab blacklist <number> : Set the amount of time in which EasyTab will skip trying to assist your
	Main Assist, if the Main Assist could not be found. If <number> is omitted, displays the current
	blacklist duration.
/easytab target : Attempt to find a target. This is the same as pressing the key bound to "Find Target"
	under Keybindings. Useful for macros.
/easytab help (or just /easytab) : Display version information and usage instructions.

Thanks for trying EasyTab! =)
