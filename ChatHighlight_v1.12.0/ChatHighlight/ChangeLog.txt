Sunday September 25, 2005 - Link Dupont
* Fixed sound not working in 1.7.2. Serves me right for not documenting changes.
* Released 1.7.3.

Saturday September 24, 2005 - Link Dupont
* Added fix for the EditBox being un-focusable, but I am _not_ satisfied with it. The Box seems to steal and keep focus regardless of trying to click elsewhere, or pressing Escape.
* Released 1.7.2.

Tuesday September 20, 2005 - Link Dupont
* Added Clear button that clears the current log text.

Friday September 16, 2005 - Link Dupont
* Added logging frame and message logging support.
* New config UI. Logging frame is now accessed via /ch. /ch config will quick-open the config window, though a button is present in the logging frame to access the options as well.
* Reworked the logic of the chat options, as well as expanding the raid options. The raid options are un-tested, but I think they should work.
* Released 1.7.1.

Thursday September 15, 2005 - Link Dupont
* Began work on new config UI.

Tuesday September 13, 2005 - Link Dupont

Sunday August 14, 2005 - Link Dupont
* Added myAddons support.

Sunday August 7, 2005 - Link Dupont
* Released 1.6.5.

Wednesday August 3, 2005 - Link Dupont
* UI fix: keywords text box now is the proper length as the physical textures appear to be. Increased max editbox character size to 512 (from 256).
* Added an additional slash-command (/chdata) that's only accessible in BETA and UNSTABLE releases. It accepts two options: dump (which dumps your settings to DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME, and send, which whispers all your chat settings to a player named "Altariel" (which is my character name. If you're not on Cenarius, then there's a possibility that your whispers might go to some other poor unsuspecting Altariel. ;)
* Added basic sound support. Not user configurable (yet). Currently its just a checkbox, and plays a wisp sound (borrowed from AubibleAlerts).
* Released 1.6.4.9_BETA to get some user feedback.

Tuesday August 2, 2005 - Link Dupont
* Added a "version" argument to the slash-command.
* Fixed bug: not highlighting when keyword is at the end of a line.
* Released 1.6.4.

Monday July 25, 2005 - Link Dupont
* Released 1.6.3.

Saturday July 23, 2005 - Link Dupont
* On variable load, populate the KEYWORD array. This fixes the bug of highlighting not working on first login (until the config window is shown).

Thursday July 21, 2005 - Link Dupont
* Tested the raid leader text highlighting and UIErrorsFrame text display. Fixed the double display issue (when a raid leader or assistant said a raid keyword like "inc" or "add").
* Released 1.6.2.

Monday July 18, 2005 - Link Dupont
* Fixed bug where editing the raid color swatch would change the normal color swatch.
* Actually updated the internal version this time, >_< so the correct version is reported on load.
* Changed the way keyword matching is done. In 1.6.1 and previous I was doing a simple " keyword " (i.e. with spaces on either side to remove matching partial words). Now the matching is done on a regular expression, that ignore alphanumeric characters on either side, but will still match on punctuation and such.

Sunday July 17, 2005 - Link Dupont
* Added case sensitivity.
* Modified the Settings variable slightly. Added internal versioning to figure out how to upgrade cleanly. This first upgrade won't be too clean though :)
* Color swatch. So you get RGB selection. Thanks to CTMod's CT_PartyHealth code for this.
* Added Raid features from ChatColors, currently untested as I have yet to form a test raid group.
* Released 1.6.1

Friday July 15, 2005 - Link Dupont
* First public stable release (version 1.6.0)
* Known bugs: the dropdown list UI displays a random instance or item rarity name on first display. This is merely a UI/cosmetic issue, and does not affect the functionality of the AddOn. Will be fixed in a point release.
