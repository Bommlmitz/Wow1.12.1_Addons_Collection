I.        Introduction
=======================================

MatLink is an addon rewritten from an older similar addon called ChatMats. Basically the purpose
of MatLink is to allow you to simply alt-leftclick on a recipe/pattern in your crafting window and
print out all of the materials needed in the chat window.

For example, you could alt-leftclick on the icon for Big Bag of Enchantment in the crafting window
and you would get this:

To [Johndoe]: Materials needed for [Big Bag of Enchantment] are:
To [Johndoe]: [Bolt of Runecloth]x6 [Large Brilliant Shard]x4 [Enchanted Leather]x4 [Ironweb Spider Silk]x4

All of the items are formatted links and are clickable.

=======================================

Step 1: Open up the chat box edit window by pressing Enter or /r or /g (basically any channel you want
        send the materials to.

Step 2: Open up the crafting profession window that you wish to link materials from. (This can either be Tailoring,
        Blacksmithing, Enchanting, First Aid, Cooking, etc...)

Step 3: Click on the recipe that you want from the list.

Step 4: Alt+Left Click on the product icon in the material window and the materials should pass through chat and
        to your target.
