Q: World of Warcraft complains about deprecated/out-of-date addons after
   a WoW patch. Where can I get an update?

A: Where ever you got this version if this is necessary at all. World of 
   Warcraft changes interface version after every major patch. It is 
   possible that an addon might not work anymore (concerning deprecated 
   methods) so WoW grouses because the addon was not explicitly written for
   this interface version.
   However, in most cases it does work nevertheless. Therefore it is 
   necessary that you activate "Load out of date addons" after clicking on 
   "Addons" in the character selection screen. After this make sure that 
   the check buttons in front of flagRSP, flagRSPLoader and Friendlist are 
   ticked.


Q: If I update to a newer version of flagRSP will my settings and 
   Friendlist entries remain?

A: Of course. These settings are saved by WoW separately in a special 
   directory. Updating flagRSP will not make WoW delete these files. 
   However, since data loss because of crashes or bugs can never be 
   precluded you should backup these settings as often as possible. See
   flagRSP documentation under SAFETY for details.


Q: flagRSP is using another font for the InfoBox since version 0.4.1. I want
   the old font back!

A: Simple. Open the file Friendlist.xml in the directory 
   Interface\Addons\flagRSP. There you will find an entry beginning with
   '<FontString name="FlagRSPFont"'. In this line replace 
   'inherits="GameFontNormal"' through 'inherits="FlagRSPFontAlt"'. This
   should bring the old font back.
