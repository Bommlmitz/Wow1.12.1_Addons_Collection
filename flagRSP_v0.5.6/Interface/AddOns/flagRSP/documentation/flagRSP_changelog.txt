Version 0.5.5 released.

11/27/2005
flokru: flagRSP will show guilds in light mode if guild option is set to 
        display all guilds

11/26/2005
flokru: flagRSPLoader will load flagRSP after 1 second of being in game.
        Therefore the FriendsFrame opening time at startup will be much 
        shorter than before.
flokru: Light tooltip mode will show ranks just as WoW itself does.
flokru: Added "/rsp purge" to instantly delete all saved flags.
flokru: Went over the toc files. Rewrote the addons's notes and added a 
        feature for WoW 1.9.0.

11/25/2005
flokru: InfoBox for hunter's pets should no longer contain information about
        characters with the same name.
flokru: Changed flagRSP to make Acutioneer able to load itself.

11/24/2005
flokru: Assertion 1 bug with French client fixed and sorting method 
        optimized.

Version 0.5.4 released.

11/15/2005
flokru: Made the character page for RP type and character status a little 
        bit more compact to make French explanations fit into this window.
flokru: Implemented French localization from Shanyu.

11/12/2005
flokru: Improved tooltip handling functions to generate tooltip content 
        faster. Performance has been improved slightly.
flokru: Changed "/rsp owntooltip". After being called it will hold tooltip
        opened until called again. 
flokru: Added flagRSPLoader, a small size addon to manage loading of 
        flagRSP. Also supports (de)activation of flagRSP loading in general,
        for current realm and for current character.
        Can be accessed via "/rspload ?". By default flagRSP will be loaded
        for any character and realm.

11/11/2005
flokru: Made flagRSP load on demand ready.
flokru: Changed "/rsp owntooltip" to use GameTooltip instead of own tooltip.
flokru: Cleaned up some unsused functions.

11/10/2005
flokru: flagRSP will now save the setting for "/rsp standby" over session. 
        This could help users playing on PvE/PvP realms on which they don't
        want flagRSP functionality. Since load on demand does not work yet
        this is a small consolation for those users.
flokru: Added rudimentary support for myAddons.
flokru: flagRSP's add/edit dialogs for Friendlist are movable.
flokru: Moved documentation files into flagRSP directory to keep them out of
        WoW's main directory.
flokru: Added popup entry for "Toggle InfoBox".
flokru: Fixed a bug that caused problems with other chatframe event hooking
        addons like GuildEventManager or GuildAds.

11/09/2005
flokru: Added an entry to add/edit Friendlist entry for selected player to 
        the popup menu that can be opened by right clicking the portrait of
        the selected player.
flokru: flagRSP will now save the maximum number of online users in a small 
        buffered list for the last ten sessions. With this data an average 
        value is calculated. This value determines the inital posting 
        interval for flagRSP.
flokru: Enhanced /rsp stat so that it also shows the maximum bytes per  
        second of one six minute interval.
PSP
11/07/2005
flokru: Merged Friendlist files into flagRSP directory.
flokru: Added a cooldown count for the notification sound for foes.
flokru: Friendlist entries can be edited by simply double clicking them.

11/06/2005
flokru: Improved InfoBox update mechanism. Performance should have increased
        a lot. There were some problematic lines that could cause fps 
        decreases (up to 30 fps decrease if update routine was run 
        repeatedly) or stutters.
flokru: InfoBox update routines are only called once in a second.
flokru: Implemented "/rsp collect" to stop flagRSP from sending flags after
        being AFKed. flagRSP will just go on sending flags after AFK. This 
        is intended to be able to collect flags and descriptions (e.g. of 
        the other faction) without having to interrupt afk again and again.
flokru: Enhanced "/rsp stat" to give some infos about saved flags.
flokru: Got rid of old variables that saved flags during a session and that 
        are not needed anymore.

11/05/2005
flokru: Fixed an ugly bug in the FlagHandler routines. Flags were not saved
        server dependend which could lead to terrible collusions.
        The saving mechanism has been rewritten, old saved flags will be 
        lost. New flags are saved in an optimized way to save some memory.

11/04/2005
flokru: Implemented a "Did you know?" message that appears after logging in.
        This box will display tips for flagRSP users (FAQs etc.).
flokru: Friendlist update code has been improved. It should save a lot of
        CPU time (in particular if having listed many players with a lot of 
        data). Friendlist's performance should have increased sensible.
flokru: Fixed a graphic issue concerning Friendlist online texture for 
        entries.
flokru: Friendlist will sort its entries directly after being opened.

11/03/2005
flokru: flagRSP will no longer send partial descriptions.
flokru: flagRSP will pull descriptions not only after selecting the other 
        user. If this user posts an unsaved description revision flagRSP 
        will perhaps pull it instantly. The probability for this to happen
        depends on the current traffic. If the traffic is higher the 
        probability will decrease.
flokru: After changing flags flagRSP will only send changed flags, not all.
flokru: flagRSP will automatically send descriptions if they are changed.
flokru: flagRSP does now send "\eod" sign at the end of descriptions. That
        makes detecting (in)complete descriptions much more easier.

11/02/2005
flokru: Character status flag will be send with interval as well. As this 
        interval will be lower than the other (or old) interval online 
        detection is more accurate now.
flokru: flagRSP will now send flags in two intervals. One for often changed
        intervals (char status, desc revision) and one for normally not 
        changed ones. 
flokru: flagRSP now sends shorter version 2 protocol commands.

11/01/2005
flokru: Enhanced chat handling routines to make flagRSP send multiple flags
        per message. First step towards version 2 protocol.
flokru: Disabled the game menu button introduced in 0.5.3 at least 
        temporary.

Version 0.5.3 released.

10/28/2005
flokru: Implemented a welcome box.
flokru: Added a button for WoW's main menu to access the Friendlist window
        (suggested by thatoneperson from curse-gaming.com).
flokru: Players being ignored will get a "Ignored!" tooltip even if known.
flokru: Implemented Ramoon's (from English flagRSP forum) changes for 
        storyteller mode. Did some minor changes so that texts fit into the
        UI without resizing it.
flokru: Fixed a serious bug that prevented descriptions from being sent 
        after a pull.

Version 0.5.2 released.

10/23/2005
flokru: In future flagRSP will end descriptions with a special signature 
        "\eod" to make other user's flagRSP able to detect if a description
        has been saved completely (e.g. by receiving it partially). This 
        will prevent pulling of already saved descriptions. Made flagRSP 
        able to understand these signature.
flokru: flagRSP will send one piece of description in each posting interval.
        This has two reasons: 1. Since descriptions are saved persistently 
        there is (currently) no way to detect an incorrectly saved 
        description. flagRSP will not repull it and the user won't see the
        correct description. By posting parts of the description on and on
        flagRSP is forced to update the saved descriptions. This increases
        safety and stability. However, it also increases traffic which 
        causes longer posting intervals. Also flagRSP will pull a 
        description if not pulled before even if all parts have already been
        received via this method (because flagRSP currently cannot detect if
        the description is complete or not).
        In future flagRSP will be able to detect completely saved 
        descriptions so that these unnecessary pulls won't be needed 
        anymore.
        2. If cross-faction descriptions should work a user has to receive 
        as many descriptions as possible. The original pull-push method will
        only send descriptions if you meet another user (or anyone else 
        meets him who hasn't saved the description yet). By sending 
        descriptions partially you can "collect" more descriptions than 
        before.

10/20/2005
flokru: Implemented a light tooltip modifying mechanism that is far simpler
        than the standard mechanism. This new mechanism just adds lines for
        surname, title, rp and character status flags and friend state. 
        There is no support for level change, name hiding, colours and 
        anything that the standard mechanism can and will provide. This was 
        mainly implemented for interoperability with other tooltip modifying
        addons.

10/19/2005
flokru: Implemented "/rsp purgeinterval" to set how long flagRSP saves 
        cached flags and descriptions.
flokru: Fixed a bug to enable () and <> brackets in flags.

10/18/2005
flokru: flagRSP will no longer lookup standard friend list, ignore list and 
        guild list when checking if a specific user is known. Instead 
        flagRSP checks cached lists with the corresponding entries. These
        lists will be updated every 30 or 300 seconds (30: friends and 
        ignores; 300: guild members).
        Reason: These lookups seem to cost many time for large guilds (can't
        confirm that because I'm in no guild). Hopefully this will fix some 
        of the lag issues with flagRSP.

10/17/2005
flokru: Added /rspon and /rspoff (same as /rspan and /rspoff).
flokru: Fixed some minor bugs in flagRSP's functions that save descriptions.
        These changes make flagRSP (more) compatible for future multiple
        descriptions.
flokru: Introduced chat message handling functions that manage flag posting
        for flagRSP. Mainly these functions ensure that flagRSP will only 
        send one message per second to avoid bigger big chunks of data being
        transmitted. In future this handler will generate messages compliant
        to version 2 protocol.

10/16/2005
flokru: Fixed an annoying startup bug.
flokru: flagRSP will now save received flags (rp flag, surname, title) and 
        descriptions persistently. This has two major advantages: It saves 
        traffic and gives the possibility to see flags from the other 
        faction. Of course this only works if a user has already "collected"
        these flags by playing the other faction before.
flokru: Fixed a bug that could make flagRSP post old descriptions after 
        changing as a new one under absolutely weird and unrealistic 
        conditions.

10/14/2005
flokru: Added a binding to toggle InfoBox for currently selected target.
flokru: Friend state info for guilds should now be displayed even if hiding
        player names.
flokru: Fixed a bug that made guild display options useless if hiding names.
flokru: Enhanced guild display options. There are three settings available.
        Display no guild names at all, display all guild names or display 
        only names of guilds which are known (i.e. listed in Friendlist).
flokru: Implemented new data format for name, level, guild and rank display
        options. Again, these new options distinguish between character name
        and realm.
flokru: Added support for MonkeyQuest's feature to add "Quest Item" lines to
        the tooltip. MonkeyQuest could not read flagRSP's tooltips because 
        MonkeyQuest does not filter colour codes from tooltip lines. 
        Therefore MonkeyQuest could not see that a unit is a quest item.
        Works at least with MonkeyQuest 1.5.3.

10/12/2005
flokru: Fixed a bug concerning the tooltip of ignored players.
flokru: Implemented new data format for surname, title, rp flag and 
        character status that distingishes between realm names. With this
        new format different settings for these flags are possible if a user
        has two characters on different realms with the same name.
        Flags will be converted after the first start of the game with a 
        character.

10/11/2005
flokru: flagRSP sends descriptions retarded from now on to reduce large 
        packets of data send at one time. Only one package per second will
        be send.
flokru: Implemented "/rsp standby". This option will make flagRSP leave its
        data channel and stop sending own flags. This is intended for 
        players who need maximum performance (e.g. for PvP and 
        battlegrounds) or who just want the Friendlist functionality of 
        flagRSP. Normally this should not be needed. The amount of traffic
        flagRSP causes is very low. It should not affect PvP fights. 
        However, since there is a still unknown lag issue perhaps this 
        option can help to localize the cause for this lag.
        NOTE: By deactivating the chat channel you cannot send and receive
              flags (surname, title, rp flags etc.).

Version 0.5.1 released.

10/05/2005
flokru: Fixed a serious bug concerning descriptions. After changing your
        description to a shorter version other flagRSPs do not "forget"
        old parts of your description if the old description was longer.
        This should work correctly now.
flokru: There was a problem if a player's name was identical to a NPC's 
        name. flagRSP would have shown the Infobox for the player if 
        selecting the NPC. This is now fixed (partially). flagRSP will
        no longer display player flags for NPCs in the InfoBox.
        However, since flagRSP/Friendlist save options (e.g. the "Show 
        InfoBox toggle") or Friendlist entries only by name it cannot
        distinguish NPCs from players there.
        I hope this will not be that problematical since NPCs are usually
        not added that often to Friendlist and NPCs usually have names with
        two words (which players can't have).
        Making flagRSP able to distinguish between NPCs and players would
        need fundamental changes in the saved variables and such changes are
        always VERY painful and bug attracting.
flokru: flagRSP does no longer reinitialize after changing the instance 
        (Deeprun Tram, all regular instances). This caused some problems.
flokru: Fixed a bug in the statistic function.

09/25/2005
flokru: Enhanced "/rsp stat" some more for future usage enquiries.

09/24/2005
flokru: Introduced "/rsp toggletooltip" to stop flagRSP from touching the
        tooltip.

09/23/2005
flokru: Introduced "/rsp post" to instantly post the user's flags. Calling
        "/rsp" with any other option (or without options at all) will no 
        longer post flags.
flokru: Changed flagRSP's dynamic traffic management algorithm to a 
        semi-static worst-case method that should decrease the traffic it 
        causes a little bit.
flokru: Reduced a lot of overhead in the tooltip algorithms.
flokru: Enhanced the "/rsp stat" command.
flokru: Rewrote some startup messages to make clear that flagRSP is NOT 
        istantly ready.
flokru: Fixed some bugs in the xml files (relitiveTo instead relativeTo).

Version 0.5.0 released.

09/03/2005
flokru: flagRSP can now understand new data commands which will be 
        implemented in a future release. They are not introduced now to
        achieve a better downward compatibility in future.

08/30/2005
flokru: "/rsp" without parameter no longer deactivates the user's flags. 
        "/rsp toggle" will do that from now on.
flokru: Fixed a bug that caused "/rsp status" to call "/rsp stat". Now both
        commands should be available.

08/29/2005
flokru: Fixed a bug in the "owntooltip" function.

Version 0.5.0 release candidate 1 released.

08/23/2005
flokru: Fixed a weird bug concerning the position of the InfoBox button.

08/20/2005
flokru: Reintegrated "/rsp edit".
flokru: Added a new (still undocumented) option "/rsp alwaysinfobox". This
        option toggles flagRSP's InfoBox behaviour. By default Infobox only
        get reopened for a certain player if it's content changed. With this
        option you can make InfoBox open every time after changing targets.
flokru: Fixed a bug in the online detection for flagRSP users.
flokru: Fixed a minor bug concerning the tooltip for users who do not hide
        the targets level.
flokru: Added a new (still undocumented) option "/rsp uinames" to toggle 
        displaying of player's names above thier heads.

08/18/2005
flokru: flagRSP's level hiding should now work together with TooltipBuddy.
flokru: flagRSP should now be more compatible with addons that also affect 
        tooltip lines on the right side.

08/14/2005
flokru: The button to toggle the InfoBox is now detached from the 
        TargetFrame so that it is visible for users with addons that hide
        the TargetFrame. Also it is movable by right clicks.

08/13/2005
flokru: Elite units get a "level up" also for the level description in
        TargetFrame.
flokru: Added a new option "/rsp stat" to show some statistics (currently 
        only number of flagRSP users on this realm).

08/03/2005
flokru: /rsp afk is no longer needed to activate afk mode. flagRSP can now
        handle afk events by itself.

Version 0.5.0 preview release 2 released.

07/27/2005
flokru: flagRSP rp tags modified so that online/offline status can be 
        detected.

07/22/2005
flokru: Integrated Unicorn support.
flokru: flagRSP has now the ability to send RP help requests.

07/20/2005
flokru: Fixed some issues concerning the InfoBox hide/show button. The 
        button will now scale with the UI and hide if UI is hidden.

Version 0.5.0 preview release 1 released.

07/14/2005
flokru: Fixed some issues in the InfoBox functions for posting the 
        description.

07/13/2005
flokru: Changed the alternative level display for elite objects.

Version 0.4.3 released.

06/26/2005
flokru: Fixed a bug concerning the colours of tooltip and InfoBox lines of
        group or raid members.

06/22/2005
flokru: Fixed an unfixed bug. flagRSP should now really not make 
        xtensionstooltip /1.

06/19/2005
flokru: The InfoBox button at the targetframe is now only visible if InfoBox
        may contain useful information.
flokru: Made a small "x" button for the InfoBox to close it.

Version 0.4.2 released.

06/16/2005
flokru: Changed the font size of the description warning frame.
flokru:	The targetframe now has a small button to toggle the InfoBox for any
        target. This setting will be saved. If another player enters a new
        description the InfoBox will automatically popup or the button 
        begins blinking depending on FlagRSPSettings[][].InfoBoxAutoPopUp.

06/14/2005
flokru: Fixed a small bug that could give users of flagRSP errors when 
        someone sends bad data to the channel.

Version 0.4.1 released.

06/13/2005
flokru: Fixed a very stupid bug. The owner line for demons should now work
        at last.

06/12/2005
flokru: Deleted descriptions are detected correctly now.
flokru: The InfoBox will only appear when there is relevant information to
        display (i.e. everythin more than the objects name). 
flokru: flagRSP is able to notify when a new version is available.
flokru: Removed alternative font from InfoBox. flagRSP now uses the WoW 
        template "GameFontNormal" which is the standard font in WoW. This 
        was done to assure that UI mods like Insomniax (which change all WoW
        fonts) will be able to change flagRSP's font as well.
        Users who liked the old alternative font can get it back by changing
        one line by hand (documentation will follow).

Version 0.4.0 released.

06/10/2005
flokru: Own pets don't show as "unknown pet" anymore.
flokru: InfoBox can now expand up- and downwards and be locked.
flokru: Fixed some minor bugs in the skinnable line.

06/09/2005
flokru: Recoloured skinnable line. The line can be coloured traditional like
        WoW does or in a new fancy way with dynamic colours. Oops, no GUI to
        configure this yet. Users who want this have to enable it by hand
        for now (look into readme).
flokru: Fixed some bugs concerning patch 1.5.0.

06/07/2005
flokru: Added a frame with information for the description tag.
flokru: InfoBox is being hidden during combat.
flokru: InfoBox can be expanded now. When selecting a player it is 
        unexpanded by default. Clicking on it will make it expand to full
        size.

06/06/2005
flokru: Implemented a very rudimentary edit box for the description tag.
        Can be accessed via "/rsp edit". A better GUI still needed.
flokru: Fixed some description tag bugs.
flokru: Implemented description tag. No editing GUI yet. Needs testing.

06/05/2005
flokru: Enhanced InfoBox to show information like name, rp tag and stuff
        like that.
flokru: Implemented InfoBox. InfoBox is a mobile frame to display Friendlist
        notes and the upcoming description tag.
flokru: Did some minor optimizations on the update routines.

06/01/2005
flokru: The companion lines for pets ("player's minion" or "Begleiter von 
        player") should now be exactly as WoW uses them.

05/30/2005
flokru: The "Wiederbelebbar"-line (how it is called in german client, the 
        line indicating that a player can be resurrected) should now be in 
        correct colour again. Please test since I had no chance to test this
        myself. STILL NEEDED: Correct english text for this line.

Version 0.3.3 released.

05/25/2005
flokru: NPCs should not be able to get surnames as well. Hope I fixed this
        at last.
flokru: Civilian line is now coloured.

05/24/2005
flokru: Hopefully fixed a bug concerning the alternative level display of
        enemy objects with unknown level (also much higher level enemy 
        players): Their level desciption became something like 
        "punyimpossible superior". I hope I fixed this at last. Please 
        report on this!
flokru: Fixed a bug concerning tooltips of known players.
flokru: Fixed a bug: flagRSP did not save the information if guild names 
        should be displayed.
flokru: Removed some old code no longer needed which leaded to conflicts
        with other addons or macros.
flokru: Fixed a bug concerning the channel name.

05/23/2005
flokru: Fixed background colour of own tooltip.
flokru: Hopefully fixed a bug: flagRSP somehow becomes /1 on every startup.
        Have not found this bug because I disabled all other channels. 
flokru: Fixed a bug concerning tooltip for ignored players.

Version 0.3.2 released.

05/16/2005
flokru: Hopefully fixed a an odd bug. Had no chance to reconstruct this. A 
        report would be nice. If a player using flagRSP defined a surname 
        for himself and another user had a pet with the same name the pet
        would have got the other players surname. Pets don't have surnames
        from now on.
flokru: Changed colour coding in tooltips. All player units are blue by
        default (even the so called "enemy" faction). Friendly NPCs are 
        green, neutral NPCs yellow and enemy NPCs red. "Enemy" players with
        pvp are yellow if you have pvp disabled and red if pvp is enabled.
        Please report if this does not work correctly (no horde players
        could be found) or if you don't like this. Still needed: special
        colour coding for Friendlist entrys.
flokru: Changed appearance of companion line for known pets. Text is now in
        the same size as it was before.
flokru: Hopefully fixed a bug that gave totems and small pets (non fighting
        pets) a companion line.
flokru: Fixed a bug that caused guild names not to be shown at all.

Version 0.3.1 released.

05/10/2005
flokru: Integrated pet name hiding routines for english client. Please let
        me know if this works.
flokru: Fixed a serious bug concerning level display with traditional level
        display for NPCs.
flokru: Reintegrated "PvP" line for NPCs after I was told that it is needed.
        Tell me if I shall remove it or at least make it removable.

05/09/2005
flokru: Fixed a bug in german localization concerning pet name display.

Version 0.3 released.

05/09/2005
flokru: Pet names are now hidden as well. If you know their owner but not 
        the pet's name, this will be displayed accordingly. Had not yet the
        chance to test this in detail. Hope this works.
        IMPORTANT: I don't have access to the english client. I need to know
                   how the line "Companion of <playername>" (in pet's 
                   tooltip; this is the translation from german client) is 
                   called EXACTLY. Otherwise I cannot integrate that.

05/08/2005
flokru: Implemented "/rsp owntooltip" to show tooltip for yourself. 
flokru: Integrated option to set ooc/ic/ic-ffa flags. Look into readme for 
        more information on that. Don't know how well it works or if it 
        works at all. Also, I don't think the tooltip texts for that are
        optimal. Feel free to suggest better alternatives.

05/07/2005
flokru: Hopefully fixed a bug that caused enemy players to be shown with pvp
        ranks of the own faction. However, had no chance to test this yet. A
        report on this would be very fine!

05/06/2005
flokru: Integrated background and name line colors for tooltips depending on
        unit's reaction (freindly, hostile, neutral).
flokru: Rewrote tooltip mechanism once more. flagRSP does no longer wipe the
        complete tooltip. A dynamic data structure TooltipModifier controls
        what happens to the tooltips. Remaining problem: lines that are 
        unchanged lose their colours.

05/05/2005
flokru: Began implementation of tooltipHandler, a new mechanism for changing
        appearance of tooltips more dynamically.
flokru: Implemented "/rsp guilds" option to deactivate guild name display at
        all.
flokru: Fixed a bug concerning traditional level display.

Version 0.2.1 released.

05/04/2005
flokru: Implemented some more library functions.

05/03/2005
flokru: Fixed a bug concerning the detection of level tooltip line for NPCs.
flokru: Fixed a bug that caused skull&bones-units to appear as 
        "extremely punyhopelessly superior".

Version 0.2 released.

05/02/2005
flokru: Rudimentary implemented displaying of PvP ranks. Might be revised
        soon.

05/01/2005
flokru: Implemented new option "/rsp afk". Sets player to afk and stops
        posting of flags. This option should be used instead of "/afk"
        because posting of flags would disable afk.

04/30/2005
flokru: Implemented a debug mode for developers or debugging issues.
flokru: flagRSP should now autmatically mute the communication channel.

04/27/2005
flokru: Completely rewrote tooltip code. Changed alternative level display.
        Guilds are not displayed if you don't want to see unknown players
        name.

Version 0.1.1 released.

04/24/2005
flokru: Made some minor optimizations.
flokru: Fixed width of tooltips.
flokru: Added traffic management for communication channel.

Version 0.1 released.

04/18/2005
flokru: flagRSP now only rejoins chat channel if being disconnected.
flokru: Added some documentation and troubleshooting.

04/16/2005
flokru: Surnames of Friendlist are shown in tooltip even if the other
        player does not send surname tag.

04/12/2005
flokru: Players can view their own tags now by selecting a spell (scroll
        for example) but not casting it and moving the mouse over their
        character.
flokru: (Hopefully) fixed a bug that made level in targetframe reappear.
        Quick'n'dirty, not an optimal solution.
flokru: Changed the way flagRSP saves other player's tags. Before this
        their rp style was saved in a SavedVariable.

04/08/2005
flokru: Began implementation of library table FlagRSP as interface for 
        e.g. Friendlist. 
flokru: Added a new feature: Levels in targetframe are no longer hidden
        but changed in a way like the alternative level hiding does.
        Now the player gets relative information (<< for an very weak unit
        up to !! for an extremely strong unit).
flokru: Level display in targetframe is linked to level level changing
        option.
flokru: Moved hiding of level in targetframe from Friendlist to flagRSP.
flokru: All rp-flag toggling functions now save rp behaviour in another
        variable, so that reenabling rp-tag works correctly.
flokru: /rspaus does no longer delete players surname and title.
flokru: Made some interface functions for standard methods in flagRSP.
flokru: Fixed some minor bugs.

04/06/2005
flokru: Started documentation in readme.
flokru: Nearly finished localization of flagRSP (Friendlist still untouched).
flokru: Localized command line options (i.e. command line options can be 
        changed via localization files).
Z: <No Roleplayer> tooltipline removed!

04/05/2005
Z: fixed un/installer
flokru: Added readme.
flokru: Added this changelog.
flokru: Did some localization, far away from being finished.

04/02/2005
flokru: flagRSP posts even empty (or nil) name- or tile-tag. Reason: Other
        clients should notice an empty tag after deleting it.
flokru: flagRSP now sends first informations about your tags after approx.
        20 seconds.
flokru: Changed minimum width of tooltips to 250. At least a bishop in 
        Stormwind needs this space.

04/01/2005
flokru: Fixed a bug that could cause leaving chat channel after changing 
        continents for unknown reasons. flagRSP rejoins channel before each
        post.
flokru: Fixed some minor bugs and cleaned up a little.
flokru: Started localization.
