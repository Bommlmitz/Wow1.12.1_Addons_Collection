Known issues
============

These are the known bugs and issues concerning flagRSP. Some are easier to 
fix and will be fixed soon. Some are not fixable at all (at least for me).

- flagRSP is somewhat incomatible to AF_Tooltip if you want hiding of
  unknown names or display of surnames (this affects other tooltip addons
  as well).
  The main problem is that AF_Tooltip manipulates the first line of the 
  tooltip where surnames or the "<Unknown>"-flag would appear. However, 
  AF_Tooltip comes last and sets this line to the selected unit's name 
  whatever flagRSP puts in this line before.
  Unfortunately, it seems (I must admit I have not tested this very long 
  yet) I cannot do anything against it. Only solution would be: AF_Tooltip
  does no longer replace this line with UnitName but reads out the old
  content first and then reinserts it with colours and all this stuff. Feel
  free to suggest this to the developer of AF_Tooltip.

- ChatLocalizer involves a little bit to much in channel joining/leaving. 
  After changing zones it leaves ALL channels including xtensionxtooltip2 
  (flagRSP's communication channel). Not a big problem since flagRSP will 
  rejoin this channel after some time.

- SmartChat and flagRSP don't like each other. After flagRSP has posted its
  flags, SmartChat will set the flagRSP communication channel as the 
  default channel. This cannot be solved without changing SmartChat.
