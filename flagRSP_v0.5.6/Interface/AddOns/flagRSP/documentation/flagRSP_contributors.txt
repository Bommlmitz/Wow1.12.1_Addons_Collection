This file contains some people who helped me developing flagRSP. However,
there are many people not being mentioned here (too many to mention here)
I would like to thank nevertheless. Without your wishes, your advices, your
critisism, your bug reports and your nice words flagRSP would not be where
it is now! Therefore: Thank You!
