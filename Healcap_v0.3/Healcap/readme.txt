HealCap 0.3

HealCap captures healing casted on you and presents the data. It shows who healed you, for what, when your life was at where. The data is displayed via the GUI and can be reported to the raid / party. HealCap is ideal for tanks as it helps correct any healing errors and gives you a clear view of your healer's actions. Use the command /healcap in-game to toggle the interface on and off. Shift-clicking on the header will report the data in /say.
