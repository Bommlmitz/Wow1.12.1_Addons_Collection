Transmogrifier 1.31

The purpose of this small mod is to change the icons of specific items to other icons.  For instance, you can change the icon of the Gnomish Mind Control Cap to something other than the Goblin Rocket Helm icon.  Or you can change the Mithril Dragonling's icon into something other than the Arcanite Dragonling's icon.

It will have the most use to engineers or those who swap different items that share the same icon.

__ New in 1.31 __

- Just a toc change for 1.12

__ Usage __

To change an item's icon:

1. /transmogrifier or /trans
2. Drop the item to change in the left box.
3. Choose an icon to change it to on the right.
4. Hit Transmogrify.
5. Repeat for any other items.
6. When done, hit Reload so changes take effect.

Once set up and reloaded there's nothing further to do.  When the UI asks for the texture of an item, if you've told it to use another icon it will use that icon instead.

__ Limitations __

To keep this mod as small and unobtrusive to the UI as possible, a couple limitations are imposed:

- Items of the same name with different enchants can't have different icons.
- In odd places it will have the old icon, like the auction house, tradeskill windows.

__ FAQ __

Q: Is this useful at all?
A: To some.  It's a visual convenience to tell items apart at a glance.

Q: How do I include my own icons?
A: Make a 64x64 32-bit tga and drop it into Interface\Icons.  After you next load WoW, in the transmogrifier click "More..." and your icon will be included in the list.

Q: The icon choices are acting wierd, the list goes on but nothing's there.
A: Download the latest version (1.2+) and it should fix the problem.  There was a change in how textures are applied on 0.10.0.

Q: It only shows icons from that item's series.  Can I use another icon?
A: Click "More..." to expand to over 2000 icons to choose from.

Q: How do I return an icon to its original?
A: When you drop an item in the left box, the first icon choice is always the original icon.  Choose that and Untransmogrify.
