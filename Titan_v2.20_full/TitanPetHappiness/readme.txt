Titan Panel [Pet Happiness]
by FurryNeko

A good friend of mine noticed that there were no Titan
plugins to show the current state of your pets happiness.

Well, with no real previous LUA coding experience, and
90 minutes of my time, this is the result.

Simply extract into your AddOns folder and find it
under Titan Panels menus (Under Information).

Enjoy!
