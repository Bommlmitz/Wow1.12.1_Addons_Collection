It seems some gadgets are inclined to break once you take them through the Dark Portal... I was in the process of moving my shop from Gadgetzan to Area 52 (gotta stay on the forefront of goblin technology, you know) and noticed some of the gizmos I'd brought with me (other engineers' gizmos, of course) had fizzled out. So, once I'd unpacked, I set to work on building replacements. 

This one is a simple, lightweight variation on those gizmos that help you adventurers get a finer-grained difficulty estimate for those quests you're always going on. It's a smooth operator, so I've named it The Levelator (call it "John" and bring it on elevators if you're so inclined). Granted, there are a couple of others that do the same -- and still work in Outland -- but I haven't come across any yet that don't depend on unnecessarily large machinery.

INSTALLATION: Put this folder into your World Of Warcraft/Interface/AddOns folder and launch WoW.

FEATURES: Quest names will appear preceded by their recommended level in brackets (in most, but not quite all places where quest names show up in the UI). Shift-clicking quests in your log to insert them in chat will insert the level as well. Elite, dungeon, raid, and PvP quests will show a plus sign in addition to the level (e.g. '[11+] Wanted: "Hogger"').
